## In-browser real-time object detection with TensorFlow.js and React

This is a code with reference to other availble tutorials.
This will build object detection webapp to detect objects using web cam. Tensorflowjs and reactjs are the tect stack.
The app, uses the computer's webcam stream to perform real-time object detections in every frame it receives.

### The model

The model featured in the app, is a pre-trained [COCO SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd) system.

### Requirements

Only a browser and a local web server.

### Instructions

This runs on local wwbserver, this runs on python local server.
`$ python -m http.server`

Once the server is up and running, open your browser, and go to http://localhost:8000/.
